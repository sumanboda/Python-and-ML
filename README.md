## Python-and-ML
Here I have created few projects for the basic learners those who intersted to start their career towards machine learning. This projects will help them a lot.
##### Regression Projects
Given an input dataset Position_Salaries with attributes Position, Level and salary. I have applied all the regression algorithms such as Polynomial, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Regression on the dataset and found the best fit line.
##### Classification Projects
Given an input dataset, Social_Networks_Ads.csv file with the attributes User ID, Gender, Age, and Estimated. I have applied all classification algorithms Logistic, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Classification to predict the output.
##### Clustering Projects
Given an input dataset Mall_Customers.csv file with attributes  Annual Income and Expenditure Scores. I have applied all the clustering algorithms such as Hierarchical and K-Means Clustering, grouped all the customers with similar features.
